- Digital image processing is the manipulation and analysis of digital images using techniques and algorithms. It focuses on two main tasks: improving the pictorial information for human interpretation and processing image data for storage, transmission, and representation for machine perception. The history of digital image processing can be traced back to the early 1920s, and it has been used in a variety of applications, such as image enhancement, object detection, compression, medical imaging, computer vision, and augmented reality. The key stages in digital image processing include image acquisition, enhancement, restoration, morphological processing, and segmentation. 
- I benefited from Digital Image Processing Book Chapter 1: Introduction.

- The human visual system allows humans to see and interpret the visual world. Brightness adaptation helps us see objects clearly in different lighting conditions, but at any one time we can only discriminate between a smaller number of different light levels than we can perceive. Digital images are composed of pixels, each storing a value. Quantization is the process of converting a continuous analog signal into a digital representation, and saturation and noise can limit the dynamic range of an imaging system. Spatial resolution refers to the smallest discernable detail in an image, and intensity level resolution refers to the number of levels used to represent an image, with a higher number resulting in more detail. The most common number of bits used to store each intensity level is 8.

- Image enhancement is the process of making images more useful. Techniques can be divided into those that operate in the spatial domain and those that operate in the frequency domain. Basic spatial domain image enhancement operations can be reduced to the form g(x,y) = T[f(x,y)], where f(x,y) is the input image, g(x,y) is the processed image and T is some operator defined over some neighborhood of (x,y). Point processing techniques, such as negative images, thresholding and grey level transformations, manipulate the pixels of an image directly. Techniques include histogram equalization and matching adjust the distribution of grey levels in an image to improve contrast.
- I benefited from Digital Image Processing Book Chapter 3: Intensity Transformations and Spatial Filtering.
